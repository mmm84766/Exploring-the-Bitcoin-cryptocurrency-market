# Exploring-the-Bitcoin-cryptocurrency-market

In this project on Datacamp, I want to better understand the growth and impact of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies by exploring the market capitalization of different cryptocurrencies.

Techniques used in this project:

    Cleaning Data in Python
    Manipulating DataFrames with pandas

Data source: www.datacamp.com I used the cryptocurrency dataset in the year of 2017 and 2018.
